data augmentation for extend the dataset

hyperparameter search - lr, batch

some used inceptionv3 and VGG16

tranfert learning?

We removed the fully connected layers of VGG16 and wrote top layers suitable for chromosome binary classification
 to apply transfer learning. We added two dropout layers, one next to the basic model and another next to the fully 
 connected layer. There are a global average pooling layer and a batch normalization layer, which can deal with 
 overfitting and other problems. The summary of the model is shown in Figure 3.5 and the visualization is shown

Monte Carlo Dropout (MC Dropout)[1] and Deep Ensembles[16]??? dropout to prevent overfitting

confusion matrix for idea

Varifocal-Net??? looks the the best -- need to create the top levels
